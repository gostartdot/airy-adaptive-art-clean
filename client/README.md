## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Difficulty Levels

| Level | Grid Size | Cards | Time Bonus | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Easy** | 4×2 | 8 pairs | 200 pts | Perfect for beginners |
| **Medium** | 4×3 | 12 pairs | 300 pts | Balanced challenge |
| **Hard** | 4×4 | 16 pairs | 400 pts | Memory expert mode |

### Scoring System

```
Final Score = (Matches × 100) + Time Bonus - Move Penalty

Time Bonus = max(0, Base Bonus - Seconds Elapsed)
Move Penalty = max(0, (Moves - 5) × 10)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- 8 matches × 100 = 800 base points
- Time bonus: max(0, 200 - 45) = 155 points  
- Move penalty: max(0, (12 - 5) × 10) = 70 points
- **Final Score: 800 + 155 - 70 = 885 points**

## 📱 Responsive Design

The game automatically adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured layout with side-by-side controls
- **Tablet**: Optimized grid spacing and touch-friendly buttons  
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with larger touch targets


## 🔧 Key Components Breakdown

### State Management
```javascript
// Core game state
const [cards, setCards] = useState([]);           // Card grid data
const [flippedCards, setFlippedCards] = useState([]); // Currently revealed cards
const [matchedCards, setMatchedCards] = useState([]); // Successfully matched pairs
const [gameState, setGameState] = useState('menu');   // Game flow control

// Scoring and progress
const [moves, setMoves] = useState(0);            // Player move count
const [time, setTime] = useState(0);              // Elapsed time in seconds
const [score, setScore] = useState(0);            // Current score
const [bestScores, setBestScores] = useState({}); // High scores per difficulty
```

### Game Logic Flow
1. **Initialization**: Shuffle card pairs and reset game state
2. **Card Selection**: Handle player clicks with validation
3. **Match Detection**: Compare flipped cards and update state
4. **Win Condition**: Check for complete matches and calculate final score
5. **Score Persistence**: Save high scores to localStorage

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Themes
```javascript
const themes = {
  animals: ['🐶', '🐱', '🐭', '🐹', '🐰', '🦊', '🐻', '🐼'],
  fruits: ['🍎', '🍌', '🍇', '🍓', '🍑', '🍊', '🥝', '🍍'],
  space: ['🌟', '🌙', '☀️', '🪐', '🚀', '👽', '🛸', '🌍']
};
```

### Modifying Difficulty
```javascript
const customDifficulty = {
  expert: { 
    symbols: [...symbols16], // 16 unique symbols
    timeBonus: 500,
    name: 'Expert (4x8)' 
  }
};
```

### Styling Customization
The game uses Tailwind utility classes for easy theme modifications:
- **Colors**: Change gradient combinations in className strings
- **Animations**: Modify transition durations and transform effects
- **Layout**: Adjust grid columns and spacing values

## 🔊 Audio Integration

To add real sound effects, integrate with Web Audio API:

```javascript
// Example sound implementation
const playSound = (type) => {
  const audio = new Audio(`/sounds/${type}.mp3`);
  audio.play().catch(e => console.log('Sound play failed:', e));
};

// Usage in game logic
const handleCardClick = (cardId) => {
  playSound('flip');
  // ... rest of click logic
};
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **React.memo**: Consider memoizing card components for large grids
- **useCallback**: Optimize event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement for additional themes or card sets
- **Animation Performance**: Uses CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations

npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Drag and drop 'dist' folder to Netlify
